# Gateway Device Manager

This repository is part of the [LoRaBridge](https://github.com/lorabridge2/lorabridge) project.
It provides the docker image for the Device Management used on our gateway device.

The Device Manager is a self-provided Python3 application keeping track of the discovered devices via the Redis server. 
It publishes MQTT messages on the Mosquitto server for device discovery events and status (data) updates. 
These messages are picked up by the HA Integration service.
